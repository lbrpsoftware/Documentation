# AI Usage Transparency Policy

Effective Date: **01/08/2024**

## 1. Introduction  

Welcome to LBRP ! Our goal is to provide exceptional support and services to our users. As part of this commitment, we utilize cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our helpdesk services. 

## 2. What is an AI Helpdesk?  

Our AI helpdesk is an automated support system designed to assist you with inquiries related to VAT and accountancy matters. The AI system can answer common questions, provide information, and guide you through certain processes based on the data you provide and the information in our system. 

## 3. How Does the AI System Work?  

The AI helpdesk processes the data you input, such as questions about VAT filings, accountancy issues, or general financial inquiries. It then uses this data, along with relevant information from VAT records and accountancy books, to provide responses. While the system is designed to deliver accurate and helpful information, the responses generated are based on patterns observed from similar past queries and available data. 

## 4. User Interaction with AI  

When you interact with our helpdesk system, please note that: 

- You are interacting with an AI system.  Our AI-driven support agent will handle your queries automatically and provide answers based on the data fed into the system.
- Human oversight is in place.  If the AI system cannot resolve your issue or if a query requires more complex handling, you will be forwarded to a human support representative for further assistance.
     

## 5. Data Usage and Privacy  

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us: 

- **Data Handling**: Any data you provide during your interaction with the AI helpdesk is processed in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](../PrivacyPolicy/README.md) and complies with applicable data protection laws (such as [GDPR](../GDPR/README.md)).
- **Anonymity**: We ensure that your data is anonymized and aggregated where possible to prevent any personally identifiable information from being exposed unnecessarily.
- **Data Security**: We use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
     

## 6. Limitations of AI Responses  

While our AI system is designed to provide accurate information, please consider the following: 

- **Verification**: The outputs provided by the AI are suggestions based on historical data and standard processing rules. Always review the information provided, and consult a human support agent if needed.
- **Liability**: Please note that LBRP is not liable for any financial losses or other consequences arising from actions taken based on AI-provided information without verification.
     

## 7. Your Rights and Choices  

As a user, you have rights regarding your interaction with our AI system: 

- **Right to Human Intervention**: You may opt to request human oversight at any stage during your interaction with the AI helpdesk. Just ask, and we'll connect you with a support representative.
- **Right to Data**: You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your data processed by our AI system. Refer to our [Data Privacy Policy](../DPA/README.md) for more details on how to exercise these rights.

## 8. Feedback and Improvements  

We are committed to continuous improvement: 

- **Feedback**: Your feedback is crucial. If you have any suggestions, concerns, or issues related to the AI helpdesk, please contact us at [info\@lbrp.be](mailto:info@lbrp.be?subject=AIPolicy).
